# BMI Calculator in Python

This is a simple Python script for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's input for **weight** (in kilograms) and **height** (in meters). The result is a BMI value with a health classification (underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese)

A simple Python script to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index) based on user input for weight and height, with health status classification

## Introduction

This Python script helps calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using basic input from the user. It provides an easy way to determine whether someone is underweight, of normal weight, overweight, or obese based on their BMI value. This script can be used for learning purposes, health tracking, or for quick calculations.

## How It Works

The BMI Calculator takes the user's weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters) as inputs. It then applies the BMI formula to calculate the BMI value. Based on the BMI, the script classifies the user into one of several categories, such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

## Formula

The formula for calculating BMI is:

\[
BMI = \frac{weight (kg)}{height (m)^2}
\]

This means the weight in kilograms is divided by the square of the height in meters.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x** must be installed on your machine.
